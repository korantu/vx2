--Write more surface tests;
--Make timings;
--Write IO properly; It is horrible at the moment.

goals:
  - make nicer graphics => not exactly sure what kind of graphics is
  required => the easier it is to try new graphics the more new
  pictures I can get.

  - tests are the correct approach, the cleaner things are, the better
    chances I can do something here.

  - try to make things as thin as possible:
      assume we have opengl.
      assume we can draw a scene.
      assume we know how to prepare the screen.     

  ortogonal tasks for opengl:
    initialize 
    perform loop
    initialize rotations
